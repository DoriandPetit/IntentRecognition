# IntentRecognition
Practical Work on an intent recognition task from audio recordings. 

The goal was to recognize the intent (approval/prohibition and attention) from audio signals. Two different databases were used, one came from baby speeches while the other one was robot audios. Different experiments have been made, to check different features, their importances, as well as ways to combine the datasets.
